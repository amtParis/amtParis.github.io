  <h1>We Two, How Long We Were <span class="green">Fool'd</span></h1>
  
  <div class="line-decoration"></div>

  <section>
  <p>We two, how long we were fool'd,
  Now transmuted, we swiftly escape as Nature escapes,
  We are Nature, long have we been absent, but now we return,</p>
  
  <p class="narrow">We become plants, trunks, foliage, roots, bark,
  We are bedded in the ground, we are rocks,
  We are oaks, we grow in the openings side by side,
  We browse, we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any,
  We are two fishes swimming in the sea together,
  We are what locust blossoms are, we drop scent around lanes mornings
      and evenings,
  
  <p>We are also the coarse smut of beasts, vegetables, minerals,
  
  <p>We are two predatory hawks, we soar above and look down,
  
  <p>We are two resplendent suns, we it is who balance ourselves orbic
      and stellar, we are as two comets,
  
  <p class="large quote green">We prowl fang'd and four-footed in the woods, we spring on prey,
  
  <p>We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead,
  We are seas mingling, we are two of those cheerful waves rolling
      over each other and interwetting each other,
  We are what the atmosphere is, transparent, receptive, pervious, impervious,
  We are snow, rain, cold, darkness, we are each product and influence
      of the globe,
  
  <p>We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two,
  
  <p class="ending">We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy.
